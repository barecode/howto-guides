# barecode's "howto" guides

My memory is terrible, and I don't code as often as I would look. As such I almost always have to "re-learn" things when I set down to write code. That's frusterating and a waste of time. Most tutorials out there assume little knowledge on the part of the programmer - everyone has to start there. But sometimes you just want a quick reference. Something that is just enough to jog your memory. That's what these "how to" guides are.

This guides are written with the assumption that you know enough to be dangerous... or at least you used to!

I am building these guides as I learn (or re-learn) various technologies and I want to store them for my own use and (hopefully) the use of others.

If you like what I've done, that's great! If not, don't use it :)
